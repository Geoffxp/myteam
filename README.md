### If I had more time on this project what would I improve and why?

I would fix the unwanted box highlighting on my card buttons on mobile.  
I would also trim down my css and organize all of the code better,   
as well as fix some naming conventions on classes I made in a hurry.  
I think that the background elements would look nice with a little bit of animation too!  
I also need to check for layout / font-size problems when gradually stepping down between target resolutions.
